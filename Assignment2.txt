1.	Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
nl=[]
for x in range(1500, 2701):
    if (x%7==0) and (x%5==0):
        nl.append(str(x))
print (','.join(nl))
2.	Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them printed in the reverse order with a space between first name and last name.
firstname = input("Input your First Name : ")
lastname = input("Input your Last Name : ")
print(lastname[::-1] + " " + firstname[::-1])
3.	Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm.
Diameter=12.0
pi = 3.1415926535897931
r= Diameter/2
V= 4.0/3.0*pi* r**3
print('The volume of the sphere is: ',V)
4.	Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list.
values = input("Input some comma seprated numbers : ")
list = values.split(",")
print('List : ',list)
5.	Create the below pattern using nested for loop in Python.
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
* * * *
* * *
* *
*


n=5;
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i):
        print ('* ', end="")
    print('')

for i in range(n,0,-1):
    for j in range(i):
        print('* ', end="")
               print('')
6.	Write a Python program to reverse a word after accepting the input from the user.
word = input("Input a word to reverse: ")
for char in range(len(word) - 1, -1, -1):
  print(word[char], end="")
print('')
7.	Write a Python Program to print the given string in the format specified in the sample output. WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN, SOCIALIST, SECULAR, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens

print("WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA,\n\t  having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN,! \n\t\t\t SOCIALIST, SECULAR, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC \n\t\t\t  and to secure to all its citizens")
